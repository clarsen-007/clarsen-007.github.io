    <title>( 3 ) - Windows is Stacking</title>
    <link></link>

        <p>Windows TCP/IP stack</p>
        <pre>
        Believe it or not, Windows is STILL experiencing remote code execution vulnerabilities in its TCP/IP stack.
        As we know, that's the last place you want to have such vulnerabilities because it is by definition exposed to the world.
        One flaw that Microsoft fixed last week was found in the way Windows handles IPv4 “source routing” and the other was in the way Windows handles IPv6 packet reassembly.
        
        Here's what Rapid7 has to say about IP Source Routing:
        “The host is configured to honor IP source routingoptions.
        Source routing is a feature of the IP protocol which allows the sender of a packet tospecify which route the packet should take on the way to its destination (and on the way back).
        Source routing was originally designed to be used when a host did not have proper defaultroutes in its routing table.
        However, source routing is rarely used for legitimate purposesnowadays.
        Attackers can abuse source routing to bypass firewalls or to map your network.”
        </pre> 

        <p>Android SHAREit</p>
        <pre>
        Google Play store lists it as: “SHAREit -Transfer & Share”
        It is a super-popular file exchange app.
        https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/b/shareit-flaw-could-lead-to-remote-code-execution.html
        
        It was Trend Micro who examined, discovered and reported the problem to SHAREit's publisher,and received no feedback.
        Trend Micro wrote:
        “We discovered several vulnerabilities in the application named SHAREit.
        The vulnerabilities canbe abused to leak a user’s sensitive data and execute arbitrary code with SHAREit permissionsby using a malicious code or app.
        They can also potentially lead to Remote Code Execution(RCE).
        In the past, vulnerabilities that can be used to download and steal files from users’devices have also been associated with the app.
        While the app allows the transfer and downloadof various file types, such as Android Package (APK), the vulnerabilities related to these featuresare most likely unintended flaws.”

    <title>( 2 ) - iOS 14.2 fixes three 0-day vulnerabilities</title>

        <p>iOS 14.2 fixes three 0-day vulnerabilities</p>
        <ul><li>CVE-2020-27930 — a remote code execution issue in the iOS FontParser component that letsattackers run code remotely on iOS devices.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>CVE-2020-27932 — a privilege escalation vulnerability in the iOS kernel that lets attackersrun malicious code with kernel-level privileges.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>CVE-2020-27950 — a memory leak in the iOS kernel that allows attackers to retrievecontent from an iOS device's kernel memory.</li></ul>
        <pre>
        All three bugs are believed to have been used together to form a highly sophisticated exploitchain,
        allowing attackers to compromise iPhone devices remotely.

        <p><H1>Feds Seize $1B in Bitcoin from Silk Road</H1></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The feds have seized its largest stash ever of Bitcoin, originating from the notorious Silk Road underground marketplace.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Silk Road was known for the place to go to broker illegal drugs,</p>
        <p>murder-for-hire, child pornography and malware – such as password stealers,</p>
        <p>keyloggers and remote access tools.</p>
        <p>In 2013 the FBI shuttered it, arresting founder Ross William Ulbricht (a.k.a. Dread Pirate Roberts).</p>
        <p>Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 for a range of crimes including computer hacking,</p>
        <p>and was sentenced to a double life sentence plus 40 years, without the possibility of parole.</p>
